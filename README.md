# bm-test

Coding test for BuzzMove, by Ben Hodgson

## Getting started

This is a pretty straightforward React + Webpack app.

Clone this repo and use your favourite package manager command (npm or yarn) to install.

To spin up a dev server on `localhost:3000` just run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

## Tests

Tests are written with Jest, Enzyme and Sinon.

To run use `npm test` or `yarn test`

## API

Makes real HTTP requests to a tiny mock API running on Heroku.

It's running on a free dyno, so response times may not be too hot if it's gone to sleep.
